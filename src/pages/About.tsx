            <h2>WHO WE ARE</h2>
            <p>GP Guide is a professional documentation platform built specifically for Australian general practitioners and health practitioners. We understand the administrative burden facing modern medical practice, and we're here to help.</p>
            <p>Founded by Australian GPs who experienced firsthand the growing documentation demands of contemporary practice, GP Guide was created to give time back to doctors‚Äîtime to focus on patients, not paperwork.</p>
            
            <hr />

            <h2 id="our-story">OUR STORY</h2>
            <h3>The Challenge:</h3>
            <p>Every Australian GP knows the feeling‚Äîrunning late in clinic because each patient requires extensive documentation. Care plans that take 30 minutes to complete. Mental health plans with repetitive formatting. DEXA reports requiring manual interpretation. Centrelink forms demanding detailed assessments.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, patients are waiting. Families are missing you at home. And the administrative burden keeps growing.</p>
            <h3>The Solution:</h3>
            <p>GP Guide was born from this frustration. Our founding team‚Äîpracticing Australian GPs‚Äîasked a simple question:</p>
            <blockquote>"What if we could generate professional, guideline-based documentation templates in minutes instead of hours?"</blockquote>
            <p>From that question, GP Guide was created.</p>
            
            <hr />

            <h2>WHAT WE DO</h2>
            <p>GP Guide provides AI-powered template generation tools for common clinical documentation tasks:</p>

            <h2>HOW WE'RE DIFFERENT</h2>
            <h3>üá¶üá∫ Built for Australian Practice</h3>
            <p>We're not a generic international product adapted for Australia. GP Guide was built from the ground up for Australian general practice, incorporating:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>MBS item requirements</li>
                <li>PBS prescribing criteria</li>

                <li>Australian Privacy Principles compliance</li>
                <li>Local terminology and practice patterns</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>üìù Education, Not Automation</h3>
            <p>We believe in augmenting clinical expertise, not replacing it. GP Guide provides educational draft templates that practitioners review, customize, and approve‚Äînever automated decisions.</p>
            <h3>üîí Privacy-First Architecture</h3>
            <p>We built GP Guide with privacy as a core principle:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>No patient-identifiable data storage</li>
                <li>Templates generated in real-time</li>
                <li>Bank-level encryption (AES-256)</li>
                <li>Australian Privacy Principles compliant</li>
                <li>You control all exported documents</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>‚ö° Time Back to You</h3>
            <p>Our mission is simple: Give Australian GPs time back. Time for patients. Time for family. Time for life outside the clinic.</p>
