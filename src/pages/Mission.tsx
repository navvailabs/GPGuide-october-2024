            <h2>THE PROBLEM WE'RE SOLVING</h2>
            <p>Australian general practice is in crisis.</p>
            <h3>GP Burnout</h3>
            <p>Studies show that over 50% of Australian GPs experience burnout. Administrative burden is a leading cause.</p>
            <h3>Time Pressure</h3>
            <p>The average GP consultation is 15 minutes, but documentation can take just as long‚Äîor longer.</p>
            <h3>After-Hours Work</h3>
            <p>Many GPs spend 10+ hours per week completing paperwork outside clinic hours, sacrificing family time and personal wellbeing.</p>
            <h3>Administrative Burden</h3>
            <p>Care plans, mental health plans, WorkCover reports, Centrelink forms‚Äîthe paperwork never ends.</p>
            <h3>Workforce Shortage</h3>
            <p>Australia faces a critical GP shortage, yet existing GPs are drowning in administration rather than seeing more patients.</p>

            <hr />

            <h2>WHY THIS MATTERS</h2>
            <p>When GPs spend hours on paperwork:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>‚ùå Patients wait longer for appointments</li>
                <li>‚ùå Doctors experience burnout and leave the profession</li>
                <li>‚ùå Families miss out on time with their loved ones</li>
                <li>‚ùå Rural and remote areas lose vital medical services</li>
                <li>‚ùå Healthcare costs increase due to inefficiency</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We believe there's a better way.</p>

            <hr />

            <h2>OUR SOLUTION</h2>
            <p>GP Guide exists to solve one core problem: <strong>administrative inefficiency in Australian general practice.</strong></p>
            <p>We provide:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>‚úì AI-powered template generation tools</li>
                <li>‚úì Guidelines-based documentation assistance</li>
                <li>‚úì Time-saving automation for repetitive tasks</li>
                <li>‚úì Professional, customizable outputs</li>
                <li>‚úì Privacy-first architecture</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Our tools help GPs complete documentation in <strong>minutes instead of hours</strong>, while maintaining professional standards and clinical quality.</p>
            
            <hr />

            <h2>OUR VISION</h2>
            <p>We envision an Australia where:</p>
            <h3>üë®‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è GPs Finish Work On Time</h3>
            <p>Imagine completing your clinic day at 5 PM‚Äînot 8 PM‚Äîbecause documentation is efficient and streamlined.</p>
            <h3>üë• More Time for Patients</h3>
            <p>When paperwork takes less time, GPs can see more patients, spend more time in consultations, and provide better care.</p>
            <h3>üè° Better Work-Life Balance</h3>
            <p>GPs shouldn't have to choose between their career and their family. We want to help doctors have both.</p>
            <h3>üåè Sustainable General Practice</h3>
            <p>By reducing administrative burden, we help make general practice more attractive to medical graduates and more sustainable for experienced GPs.</p>
            <h3>üá¶üá∫ Stronger Australian Healthcare</h3>
            <p>Efficient, happy GPs mean better healthcare access for all Australians‚Äîin cities, suburbs, and remote communities.</p>

            <h2>OUR CORE VALUES</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Patient Safety First</strong><br/>
                    Clinical safety is non-negotiable. GP Guide is designed as an educational tool that supports‚Äînever replaces‚Äîclinical judgment and patient assessment. Every template requires practitioner review. Every output is customizable. Every user remains clinically responsible.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Practitioner Wellbeing</strong><br/>
                    We care about GP wellbeing. Burnout serves no one‚Äînot doctors, not patients, not families. By giving time back to GPs, we hope to contribute to a more sustainable, rewarding career in general practice.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Privacy Protection</strong><br/>
                    Patient privacy is sacred. GP Guide is built with privacy-first architecture: No patient-identifiable data storage, Real-time template generation, Bank-level encryption, Australian Privacy Principles compliance. We will never compromise on privacy.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Australian Focus</strong><br/>
                    We're laser-focused on serving Australian general practice‚Äînot international markets. Our tools reference Australian guidelines (RACGP, MBS, PBS, eTG). Our support team is Australian. Our company is Australian-owned. We understand Australian practice because we ARE Australian practice.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Professional Excellence</strong><br/>
                    We believe in maintaining the highest standards of professional documentation. GP Guide templates reference current guidelines and evidence-based practice. We support clinical excellence, not shortcuts.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Affordability and Accessibility</strong><br/>
                    Quality clinical tools shouldn't be limited to large corporate practices. GP Guide is priced to be accessible to solo GPs, registrars, and practitioners at all career stages. Everyone deserves access to efficiency.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Continuous Improvement</strong><br/>
                    Healthcare evolves. Guidelines change. We evolve with it. We're committed to regular updates, user feedback integration, and continuous improvement of our tools.
                </li>
            </ol>
